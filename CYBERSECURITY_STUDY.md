- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Role-based access appropriate to each context
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store necessary information
- **Secure by Design**: Security considerations built into each application from the start

## 🔒 Cybersecurity Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. **Authentication vs Authorization Across Multiple Systems**

#### What It Is:
- **Authentication**: "Who are you?" - Verifying user identity
- **Authorization**: "What can you do?" - Determining user permissions

#### How I Implemented It Across Projects:

**Aviation Crew API - Critical Infrastructure**:
```javascript
// Authentication: JWT token verification
const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY);

// Authorization: Role-based access control
if (decoded.role === 'pilot') {
    // Full access to flight communications
} else if (decoded.role === 'flight_attendant') {
    // Limited access to cabin communications
} else if (decoded.role === 'ground_crew') {
    // Access only to ground operations
}
```

**SkyLink Menu - Transaction Security**:
```javascript
// Session-based authorization for meal ordering
function validateOrderPermissions(sessionId, mealSelection) {
    const session = sessions.get(sessionId);
    if (!session || !session.authenticated) {
        throw new SecurityError('Unauthorized meal order attempt');
    }
    return sanitizeOrderData(mealSelection);
}
```

**SkyLink Menu - Premium Transaction Security**:
```javascript
// Secure order processing with validation
function processOrder(orderData, sessionToken) {
    // Authenticate session
    const session = validateSession(sessionToken);
    if (!session.isPremium) {
        throw new SecurityError('Access denied: Premium service required');
    }
    
    // Validate order data
    const sanitizedOrder = {
        mealId: validateMealId(orderData.mealId),
        preferences: sanitizeInput(orderData.preferences),
        seatNumber: validateSeatFormat(orderData.seatNumber)
    };
    
    // Log security event
    logSecurityEvent('PREMIUM_ORDER_PROCESSED', {
        userId: session.userId,
        orderValue: sanitizedOrder.totalAmount,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
    
    return sanitizedOrder;
}
```

#### Real-World Aviation Context:
- **Pilots**: Need access to critical flight data, weather, and ATC communications
- **Flight Attendants**: Need cabin communication and safety alerts  
- **First-Class Passengers**: Access to premium dining services and personalized preferences
- **Economy Passengers**: Limited access to basic services and entertainment
- **Ground Crew**: Access only to ground operations and maintenance
- **Unauthorized users**: Should have NO access to any aviation communications or services

---

### 2. **JSON Web Tokens (JWT) Security**

#### What It Is:
JWTs are secure tokens that contain user information and expire automatically, preventing session hijacking.

#### Why It's Critical in Aviation:
- **Stateless authentication**: No server-side session storage reduces attack surface
- **Tamper-proof**: Digitally signed tokens can't be modified without detection
- **Automatic expiration**: Tokens expire to limit damage if compromised
- **Cross-system compatibility**: Works across different aviation systems

#### How I Implemented It:
```javascript
// Token creation with expiration
const token = jwt.sign(
    { 
        userId: user.id, 
        role: user.role,
        clearanceLevel: user.clearanceLevel
    },
    SECRET_KEY,
    { expiresIn: '8h' } // Shift-length expiration
);
```

#### Security Benefits:
- **No password transmission**: After initial login, only tokens are sent
- **Role verification**: Every request includes user role for authorization
- **Time-limited access**: Tokens expire, forcing re-authentication

---

### 3. **Message Encryption**

#### What It Is:
Encrypting communication data so that even if intercepted, it cannot be read by unauthorized parties.

#### Why Aviation Needs It:
- **Flight plans**: Route information must stay confidential
- **Passenger manifests**: Personal data protection (PII)
- **Maintenance reports**: Safety-critical information
- **Emergency communications**: Life-or-death information security

#### How I Implemented It:
```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

// Encrypt sensitive messages
function encryptMessage(message) {
    const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-cbc', ENCRYPTION_KEY);
    let encrypted = cipher.update(message, 'utf8', 'hex');
    encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
    return encrypted;
}

// Decrypt for authorized users
function decryptMessage(encryptedMessage) {
    const decipher = crypto.createDecipher('aes-256-cbc', ENCRYPTION_KEY);
    let decrypted = decipher.update(encryptedMessage, 'hex', 'utf8');
    decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');
    return decrypted;
}
```

#### Real-World Scenario Examples:

**Premium Dining Security (SkyLink Menu)**:
> "When a first-class passenger orders a gourmet meal, the system must verify their premium status, validate their meal preferences, and securely process their dietary restrictions. If someone tries to access the premium menu without proper authorization, they should be denied access while still being able to view basic dining options."

**Flight Operations Security (Aviation Crew API)**:
> "When a pilot sends a message about a mechanical issue, it's encrypted so that if someone intercepts the transmission, they can't read sensitive information about aircraft vulnerabilities or passenger safety."

**Task Management Security (SkyList)**:
> "Flight crew task assignments must be properly validated to ensure only authorized crew members can modify safety-critical checklists and maintenance schedules."

---

### 4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

#### What It Is:
A security model where access permissions are assigned based on job roles, following the **principle of least privilege**.

#### Aviation Security Hierarchy:
```
🧑‍✈️ PILOT (Highest Clearance)
├── Flight plans and routes
├── Weather and navigation data
├── Aircraft systems status
├── Emergency protocols
└── Crew communications

👩‍✈️ FLIGHT ATTENDANT (Medium Clearance)
├── Cabin communications
├── Passenger manifests
├── Safety announcements
└── Emergency procedures

🧑‍🔧 GROUND CREW (Operational Clearance)
├── Maintenance logs
├── Pre-flight checklists
├── Baggage handling data
└── Ground operations
```

#### How I Implemented It:
```javascript
// Middleware to check role permissions
function requireRole(allowedRoles) {
    return (req, res, next) => {
        const userRole = req.user.role;
        
        if (!allowedRoles.includes(userRole)) {
            return res.status(403).json({ 
                error: 'Insufficient clearance level' 
            });
        }
        
        next();
    };
}

// Protected routes with role requirements
app.get('/api/flight-plans', 
    authenticateToken, 
    requireRole(['pilot']), 
    getFlightPlans
);

app.get('/api/cabin-status', 
    authenticateToken, 
    requireRole(['pilot', 'flight_attendant']), 
    getCabinStatus
);
```

### 5. **Input Validation & Sanitization**

#### What It Is:
Preventing malicious code injection by validating and cleaning all user inputs.

#### Aviation-Specific Threats:
- **SQL Injection**: Malicious queries could access passenger data or meal preferences
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injected scripts in communication messages or order forms
- **Command Injection**: Unauthorized system commands in task management or crew communications
- **Order Tampering**: Modifying meal orders or service requests to access premium features
- **Session Hijacking**: Stealing authentication tokens to impersonate crew or passengers

#### How I Implemented It Across Projects:

**Aviation Crew API - Critical Communications**:
```javascript
// Input validation for aviation messages
function validateMessage(message) {
    // Check for required fields
    if (!message.content || !message.priority || !message.recipient) {
        throw new Error('Missing required message fields');
    }
    
    // Sanitize content to prevent XSS
    message.content = escapeHtml(message.content);
    
    // Validate priority levels
    const validPriorities = ['routine', 'urgent', 'emergency'];
    if (!validPriorities.includes(message.priority)) {
        throw new Error('Invalid priority level');
    }
    
    return message;
}
```

**SkyLink Menu - Order Validation**:
```javascript
// Secure meal order processing
function validateMealOrder(orderData) {
    // Validate meal selection
    const validMeals = ['wagyu-beef', 'lobster-thermidor', 'truffle-risotto'];
    if (!validMeals.includes(orderData.mealId)) {
        throw new SecurityError('Invalid meal selection');
    }
    
    // Sanitize dietary preferences
    orderData.preferences = sanitizeInput(orderData.preferences);
    
    // Validate seat number format (1A-30F for first class)
    const seatPattern = /^([1-9]|[12][0-9]|30)[A-F]$/;
    if (!seatPattern.test(orderData.seatNumber)) {
        throw new SecurityError('Invalid seat assignment');
    }
    
    return orderData;
}
```

**Task Management - Crew Safety Validation**:
```javascript
// Validate safety-critical task updates
function validateTaskUpdate(taskData, userRole) {
    // Only authorized crew can modify safety tasks
    const safetyTasks = ['pre-flight-check', 'emergency-equipment', 'cabin-safety'];
    if (safetyTasks.includes(taskData.type) && userRole !== 'senior_crew') {
        throw new SecurityError('Insufficient privileges for safety task modification');
    }
    
    // Sanitize task descriptions
    taskData.description = escapeHtml(taskData.description);
    
    return taskData;
}
```

// HTML escaping to prevent XSS attacks across all systems
function escapeHtml(text) {
    const div = document.createElement('div');
    div.textContent = text;
    return div.innerHTML;
}
```
