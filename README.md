## 🔑 Key Components

### 1. Sticky Sidebar Layout
**File**: `landingpage/style.css` (lines 23-45)

The portfolio uses a split-screen layout where:
- **Left Side (Sidebar)**: Contains name, navigation, social links - stays fixed
- **Right Side (Main Content)**: Scrollable content sections

**CSS Implementation**:
```css
.container {
    display: flex;           /* Side-by-side layout */
    min-height: 100vh;       /* Full viewport height */
}

.sidebar {
    position: sticky;        /* Stays in place during scroll */
    top: 0;                 /* Stick to top of viewport */
    height: 100vh;          /* Full height */
    width: 50%;             /* Half the container */
}
```

### 2. Navigation System
**File**: `landingpage/script.js`

Features smooth scrolling and active state management:
- Detects which section is currently in view
- Updates navigation highlights accordingly
- Provides smooth scrolling to sections

### 3. Cursor Light Effect
**File**: `landingpage/index.html` (lines 320-340)

Custom JavaScript creates a following light effect:
- Tracks mouse movement in real-time
- Creates radial gradient that follows cursor
- Uses CSS `mix-blend-mode` for visual blending

### 4. Project Integration
Each project is a separate application but integrated into the portfolio:
- **SkyList Task Management**: Aviation-themed task manager with local storage persistence
- **Charlotte's Ice Cream**: Interactive website with dynamic JavaScript features
- **Secure Login System**: EJS templating with session management
- **Aviation API**: Full REST API with JWT authentication

## 🎨 Styling Approach

### Design System
- **Font Family**: Inter (Google Fonts) - modern, readable typography
- **Color Scheme**: Dark theme with slate colors
- **Accent Color**: Bright cyan (#64ffda) for highlights
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4rem (64px) spacing system
